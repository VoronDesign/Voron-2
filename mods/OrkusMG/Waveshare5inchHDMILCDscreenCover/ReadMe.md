# Screen case and Software for Waveshare 5inch HDMI LCD (B)

The screen description can be found here: [Links](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/5inch_HDMI_LCD_(B))

Screen uses original mounting hinges so you can move it as you would with original Voron screen.

Note that there is few versions of Waveshare 5" screen. I opted for B due to:

* Convenient HDMI port location
* 2 USB ports, one for power only and 2nd one for power and touch
* This screen is connected to Pi via USB and HDMI which does not require for RPi to be in the same case as screen and RPi's GPIO pins are still free to use.
* Fusion 360 and STL files for case included.

For software I use Octoscreen which does not use chromium browser like TouchUI does, this means that it has almost zero additional usage for RPi CPU.
