This is a modification to MZBot's Mobius Extruder to use dual drive Bondtech drivegears.

You will need to substitue the 45mm long 5mm diameter shaft for a 60mm long shaft
2x M3x20
1x M3x12
2x M3 Nuts
2x M3 Washers

The rest of the hardware is the same with the obvious replacement of the MK8 and bearing with Bondtech drivegears.
