This is a dual direct drive X carriage for 10mm X axis using double wide linear bearings. LM10UU or (Misumi LM10UW). It is based on 9mm GT2 belts but should work with 6mm belts.
It was intended to use magnets for a quick change out but the magnets were not strong enough.
It does use magnets on the fan mounts which do work. Your printer needs to be calibrated for proper press fit of magnets and some screw holes. Be prepared to drill out some holes if they are too tight. Glue the magnets in if they are too loose. It uses 6mmx3mm magnets and 5mm x 10mm. You need various m3 screws up to 25mm, two m3x60mm and one M4x16mm.
This can be used as a dual Bondtech BMG direct drive carriage, Dual bowden, or hybrid bowden-direct.
